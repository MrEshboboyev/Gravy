## 🧩 Design Patterns  

Gravy employs modern and proven architectural and design patterns:  

1. **Clean Architecture**  
   - Enforces separation of concerns to ensure long-term maintainability.  
   - Divides the project into **Domain**, **Application**, **Infrastructure**, and **Presentation** layers.  

2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**  
   - Focused on the **core domain logic** and encapsulating business rules.  

3. **Outbox Pattern**  
   - Ensures reliable event publishing to external systems using transactional outboxes.  

4. **Repository Pattern**  
   - Abstracts database access logic for cleaner and more testable code.

Here’s a simple example of how to create a new order:  

```csharp  
using Gravy.Application.Services;  
using Gravy.Domain.Entities;  

// Initialize the service  
var orderService = new OrderService();  

// Create a new order  
var order = await orderService.CreateOrderAsync(new Order  
{  
    CustomerId = Guid.NewGuid(),  
    DeliveryAddress = "123 Main Street, NY",  
    Items = new List<OrderItem>  
    {  
        new OrderItem { Name = "Burger", Quantity = 2, Price = 5.99M },  
        new OrderItem { Name = "Fries", Quantity = 1, Price = 2.99M }  
    }  
});  

Console.WriteLine($"Order Created! ID: {order.Id}");  
```
