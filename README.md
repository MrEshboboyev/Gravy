## 🧩 Design Patterns  

Gravy employs modern and proven architectural and design patterns:  

1. **Clean Architecture**  
   - Enforces separation of concerns to ensure long-term maintainability.  
   - Divides the project into **Domain**, **Application**, **Infrastructure**, and **Presentation** layers.  

2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**  
   - Focused on the **core domain logic** and encapsulating business rules.  

3. **Outbox Pattern**  
   - Ensures reliable event publishing to external systems using transactional outboxes.  

4. **Repository Pattern**  
   - Abstracts database access logic for cleaner and more testable code.  

5. **Result Pattern**  
   - Provides a standardized way to handle operation results, making it easier to deal with success and failure cases.  

6. **Idempotency**  
   - Ensures that operations can be performed multiple times without different outcomes, which is crucial for reliability in distributed systems.  

7. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**  
   - Separates read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.  

8. **Logging**  
   - Implements comprehensive logging to capture important events and errors, aiding in monitoring and debugging the application.

using Gravy.Domain.Entities;  

// Use the factory method to create a new order
var order = OrderCreate(
    Guid.NewGuid(),
    Guid.NewGuid(),
    Guid.NewGuid(),
    DeliveryAddress.Create(
      "street",
      "city",
      "state",
      Location.Create(
      10.0,
      12.0
   )
);
```
